1.  Introduction

   Motivation: avoid building queues, support "layered" media encoding
   or "simulcast" transmission.

   Assume that the realtime application carries media over QUIC in a
   series of QUIC streams.  Each of these streams is marked with a
   scheduling priority.  For example, in a "simulcast" service, audio
   packets may be sent as QUIC datagrams scheduled at a high priority,
   then a low definition version of the video stream in a QUIC stream
   marked at the next highest priority, then medium definition video in
   another stream, then high definition video in the lowest priority
   stream.  At any give time, the sender could schedule data according
   to the connection's capacity as evaluated by the congestion control
   algorithm.  If the path has a high capacity the receiver will receive
   all QUIC streams and enjoy a high definition experience.  If the
   capacity is lower, the higher definition streams will be delayed but
   the receiver will reliably obtain the medium or low definition
   version of the media.

   This realtime retransmission strategy relies on timely assessment of
   the path capacity by the congestion control algorithm.  If the
   assessment is delayed, the scheduling algorithm will make wrong
   decisions, such as wrongly believing that the path does not have the
   capacity to send high definition media, or in contrast sending high
   definition media and causing queues and maybe packet losses because
   the lowering of the path capacity has not yet been detected.

   Other realtime applications may use different categories of traffic
   than low or high definition video, but they will follow the genral
   principle of trying to schedule just the right amount of transmission
   to obtain a good experience without creating queues.

   In our experience, we see that BBR generally works well for these
   applications.  We have experimented with BBR V3, define by the BBRv2
   IETF Draft [cite] and by complementary data in a presentation to the
   IRTF [cite].  However, we see problems in the early stage of the
   connection, when the path capacity is not yet assessed, and during
   sudden transitions, such as experienced in Wi-Fi networks.
