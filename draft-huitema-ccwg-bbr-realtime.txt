1.  Introduction

   Motivation: avoid building queues, support "layered" media encoding
   or "simulcast" transmission.

   Assume that the realtime application carries media over QUIC in a
   series of QUIC streams [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  Each of these streams is
   marked with a scheduling priority.  For example, in a "simulcast"
   service, audio packets may be sent as QUIC datagrams scheduled at a
   high priority, then a low definition version of the video stream in a
   QUIC stream marked at the next highest priority, then medium
   definition video in another stream, then high definition video in the
   lowest priority stream.  At any give time, the sender could schedule
   data according to the connection's capacity as evaluated by the
   congestion control algorithm.  If the path has a high capacity the
   receiver will receive all QUIC streams and enjoy a high definition
   experience.  If the capacity is lower, the higher definition streams
   will be delayed but the receiver will reliably obtain the medium or
   low definition version of the media.

   This realtime retransmission strategy relies on timely assessment of
   the path capacity by the congestion control algorithm.  If the
   assessment is delayed, the scheduling algorithm will make wrong
   decisions, such as wrongly believing that the path does not have the
   capacity to send high definition media, or in contrast sending high
   definition media and causing queues and maybe packet losses because
   the lowering of the path capacity has not yet been detected.

   Other realtime applications may use different categories of traffic
   than low or high definition video, but they will follow the genral
   principle of trying to schedule just the right amount of transmission
   to obtain a good experience without creating queues.

   In our experience, we see that BBR generally works well for these
   applications.  We have experimented with BBR V3, define by the BBRv2
   IETF Draft [I-D.cardwell-iccrg-bbr-congestion-control] and by
   complementary data in a presentation to the IRTF [BBRv3-Slides].
   However, we see problems in the early stage of the connection, when
   the path capacity is not yet assessed, and during sudden transitions,
   such as experienced in Wi-Fi networks.
